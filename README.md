# Natural-Language-Processing_Restaurant-Reviews
An elementary project on the concept of Natural Language Processing that makes use of the Bag-Of-Words model and Naive Bayes Classifier to conduct sentiment analysis on the reviews of a restaurant to predict if the review is positive or negative. 
It reads a .tsv file and after futher cleaning and stemming of the text using different python libraries we obtain a sparse matrix over which we apply our Naive Bayes Classifier model and perform the prediction.
